                    <div className="px-2 flex flex-col gap-2">
                        <p>My name is Aidan Mascoli, and I am originally from Fair Lawn, New Jersey. I am currently
                        residing in Atlanta, Georgia as I study Computational Media and Computer Engineering at the
                        Georgia Institute of Technology. This fall, I will be a junior, and I am currently expecting
                        to graduate in the Spring of 2028.</p>
                        <p>I started my career at Georgia Tech as a computational media major. As I pursued my
                        coursework and discussed the direction of technology with my peers, I developed an interest in
                        the hardware platforms that the software and algorithms I studied operated on. I have taken on
                        hardware projects in the past, including robotics competitions in high school, and embedded
                        systems projects using arduino platforms. Hardware technology both facilitates and limits the
                        capability of the software that runs on it. Having an interest and experience in both can
                        enhance the capability of the combined final product.</p>
                        <p>Thus, I decided to add computer engineering as a second major. Having completed the first
                        year of the computer engineering program, I can confidently say that despite the increased
                        course load and overall difficulty of completing two majors, I am very happy with my decision to
                        enroll in the ECE program. Learning more about hardware has felt like the most rewarding
                        experience of my college career. I always enjoyed getting to the end of a software project
                        and seeing the results, but now, with hardware projects, I enjoy the final product even
                        more, looking at something tangible that I built.</p>
